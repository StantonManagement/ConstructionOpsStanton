2. **Added Data Validation Constraints** (`add_data_validation_constraints`)
   - Added CHECK constraints to prevent negative amounts
   - Added percentage validation (0-100 range)
   - Created indexes for better performance
   - Added trigger to automatically maintain project_contractor relationships

3. **Database Health Check Function** (`create_database_health_check_function`)
   - Comprehensive health monitoring
   - Detects orphaned records, invalid data, and stale conversations
   - Provides actionable insights for data quality
