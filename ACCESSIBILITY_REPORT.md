### Testing Methodology
- **Contrast Testing**: Manual calculation using hex color values from CSS variables
- **Dark Mode Testing**: Verified contrast ratios in both light and dark themes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tested tab order and focus indicators
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Verified ARIA labels and semantic markup

2. **Neutral status text**: One combination is borderline (4.3:1)

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate**: Monitor borderline contrast combinations in user testing
2. **Future**: Consider increasing contrast for secondary text on secondary backgrounds
3. **Ongoing**: Regular accessibility audits with each design update

## Testing Tools Used
- Manual contrast ratio calculations using hex color values
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing (NVDA/VoiceOver simulation)
- Browser developer tools for ARIA inspection

## Conclusion
